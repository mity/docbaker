# DocBaker Readme


## What is DocBaker

Currently, DocBaker does nothing; its development has just started.

In the future, DocBaker will hopefully become yet another tool for gathering
and generating HTML documentation from C/C++ source files.


## License

DocBaker is covered with MIT license, see the file `LICENSE.md`.


## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any bug, please be so kind and report it. Unheard bugs cannot
get fixed. You can submit bug reports here:
